# TVRemote2.0

 Have a hard time keeping up with all the great TV shows and movies out there? This will help you organize them into lists! It automatically pulls an image from IMDB to keep your lists from being sore on the eyes! Eventually the site will also remind you what shows to watch on what days, when a show is coming back, what episodes are in your queue, and much more!
 
This is a very bare-bones app for now! It needs a redesign and most of the planned functionality is yet to be implemented. There are some recorded bugs as well and the code needs to be cleaned up a bit.

# Update: OMDB (movie poster API) is no longer supported!

# Many tools/frameworks were used for this project:
 
 -Express Node.js framework
 
 -OMDB API to automatically add a cover image for each TV show/movie from IMDB
 
 -MongoLab for database
 
 -Mongoose
 
 -SASS Preprocessor
 
 -Grunt to automate compiling of SASS, and concatenation and minification of CSS and Javascript files
 
 -Used pre-built Express project-templates
 
 -Integrated user-authentication using Passport module
 
 -AJAX (UPDATE: removed because it didn't add anything but code can still be viewed in public/js/ajax.js)
 
 -JSHint
 
 -Materialize CSS framework
 
 -Form validation using connect-flash and request middleware

Run command "nodemon bin/www" (or just node) to get app running locally on port 3000.
